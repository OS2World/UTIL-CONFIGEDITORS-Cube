<li>RS() is replaced by ENV & KEY with greater flexibility.</li>
<li>Requires Object REXX rather than Classic REXX. Unfortunately, in a fresh install
Classic REXX is the default. To switch between the two REXX, type <code>switchrx</code>
at command prompt, enter "y" return and then reboot. For unattended installs, run switchrx
with input redirected a text file during last phase of the install.</li>
<li>ADDSTRING\DELSTRING now handles separation char. The biggest use of these functions
is in various paths in config.sys which normally have a semicolon at the end. However,
sometimes the terminating semicolon isn't there. Furthermore, in <code>set autostart=</code>
the comma separated string has no comma at the end (option NOTERM).</li>

<h2>DOCUMENTATION</h2>

<p> CUBE is a REXX procedure used to modify a CONFIG.SYS-like ASCII file
(the Target File), based on a set of CUBE's commands (the Procedure
File).</p>
<p> CUBE was initially developed to automatically create/update
CONFIG.SYS or STARTUP.CMD files. It may be integrated in dynamic
processes used to customize PS/2 configurations. Any other ASCII file
(such as profiles, commands files, etc...) may also be customized with
CUBE.</p>
<p> CUBE has its own set of commands (described below) that provide
editing functions at the line and string levels. This set of commands
includes ADD, REPLACE and DELETE functions.</p>
<p>Commands consist of keywords and strings. Keywords can be any case.
All strings are surrounded by a character delimiter from the set
<code class="cmd">"'`!@#$%^&amp;</code>. This set is easy to remember on a QWERTY
layout keyboard.  All 3 quotes plus shift_1 to shift_7.
Both ends of string must use the same delimiter. The case of strings are always
preserved on target modifications but for string matches, which can be modified, the default being
case insensitive.</p>
<p>Some commands have options. When using an options, the first option is preceded by a left
brace. Options, unlike parameters, may be given in any order. An option consist of a keyword
and may have a string following the keyword.</p>

<p> Most of CUBE's commands require identification of the Target File
line they act upon: the line will be identify by its leftmost
characters (as many as necessary for a precise or generic
identification) starting from column 1. This was inherited from the
CONFIG.SYS type of file CUBE was created for. However, the option
'*ID', wherever available, tells CUBE to identify the Target File line
as any line containing the identification string, starting at any
position. Furthermore, the command <a href="#lineid">LINEID</a> may specify that leading
characters in Target File lines should be ignored (stripped) for
identification or handle text profiles intelligently. You can define what defines a comment
in a Target file an exclude them from identification. You can define begin, block, trail and top
<a href="#comment">comments</a>.</p>
<p>Strings at CUBE's execution time are replaced by their current value at execution time.  
Both <code>D:\</code> is replaced with actual data path which is defined as the drive 
running CUBE and <code>C:\</code> is replaced with actual boot path.</p>
<p>Strings may be further customized at CUBE's
execution time: strings may contain 'variables' names that will be
replaced by their current value at execution time. This is known as
'substitution' and comes in two flavors: command line substitution and
environment variable substitution. Command line substitution: values
of variables are passed in the command line with the <a href="#key">KEY</a> option. Environment
variable substitution: values of variables are those of currently defined OS/2
environment variables at CUBE's execution time. Substitution in a Target File line only occurs if
this line is processed by a CUBE's command with corresponds KEY or ENV option.
The value of both keywords and environment variables, case is preserved and may include any
character including spaces. If a value is missing,  then it is flagged as an error which can
be changed by <a href="#onerror">ONERROR</a> command or preferably check with
command line option <a href="#test">TEST</a>.</p>
<p>You can select parts of a Procedure File to be executed by using both command
<a href="#when">WHEN</a> and command line option <a href="#make">MAKE</a>. These can also tested
with command line option <a href="#test">TEST</a>.</p>

<h2>CUBE Procedure File Syntax</h2>

<p>The Procedure file is a text file that is read one line at a time.
Blank lines are ignored. Comments lines may be inserted,
with either '*' or '--' as their first character(s) are also ignored.
Non-ignored lines are treated as commands.</p>

<p>Commands may span on more than one line. A comma must end the line
that is to be continued on next line. Strings can not be split.
Blank and comments lines may not appear in between continuation lines of a command.</p>

<p>Commands are divided into two groups: modifiers and functions.
Modifiers have an effect interpretation on subsequent commands.
Functions operate on the target file.<p>

<h2>Examples:</h2>

<pre>ONERROR CONTINUE</pre>
<p>continue processing even in case of error(s)</p>

<pre>REPline "COUNTRY=" with "COUNTRY=001,C:\OS2\SYSTEM\COUNTRY.SYS" (ADDBOTTOM</pre>
<p>replaces all occurrences of lines starting with "COUNTRY=" adds
new line at bottom of Target File if no line starting with "COUNTRY="
exists. "C:\" will be replaced with actual boot root directory.</p>

<pre>ADDLINE "CODEPAGE=437,850" (AFTER "COUNTRY=" IFNEW</pre>
<p>adds a line "CODEPAGE=437,850" after the line starting with
"COUNTRY=" , only if "CODEPAGE=437,850" doesn't already exist in
Target File. If it is to be added and no line starting with
"COUNTRY=" exist, then add at bottom of file (implied by AFTER).</p>

<pre>DELLINE "SET=" (first</pre>
<p>deletes the first line starting with "SET=" .</p>

<pre>DELLINE "SET=" (first ifnot "REQUIRESET"</pre>
<p>deletes the first line starting with "SET=" only if Target File does
not contain a line starting "REQUIRESET"</p>

<pre>commentline "ifs=c:\os2\hpfs.ifs" with "rem "</pre>
<p>comments the line starting with "IFS=C:\OS2\HPFS.IFS" with "REM ".
Line will then be: REM IFS=C:\OS2\HPFS.IFS . "C:\" will be replaced
with actual boot root directory.</p>

<pre>ADDSTRING "C:\MYDLL;" IN "LIBPATH=" (FIRST IFNEW BEFORE "C:\OS2\DLL;"</pre>
<p>adds "C:\MYDLL;", if it doesn't already exist, within the line
starting with "LIBPATH=". Adds the string before "C:\OS2\DLL;" if it
exists; otherwise adds the string after "LIBPATH=". "C:\" will be
replaced with actual boot root directory.</p>

<pre>addstring "c:\mybin;" in "path=" (after</pre>
<p>adds "c:\mybin;", if it doesn't already exist, within the line
starting with "path=". Note that the file seperator character is optional at the end of line
and sometimes missing. Both ADDSTRING and DELETESTRING deal intelligently with this. </p>

<pre>deletestring "warpcenter," in "set autostart=" (noterm</pre>
<p>adds "c:\mybin;", if it doesn't already exist, within the line
starting with "path=". Note that the string seperator character is not at the end of line.
Both ADDSTRING and DELETESTRING deal intelligently with this.
Remove "," from end of line if there is one.</p>

<pre>AS "MYNAME" IN "USERID" (AFTER *ID</pre>
<p>adds "MYNAME", if it doesn't already exist, within any line
containing "USERID". Adds the string after "USERID".</p>

<pre>ONERROR CONTINUE
RL "SET VALUES=" WITH "SET VALUES=%indirect%" (ADDBOTTOM ENV</pre>
<p>assuming that the command 'SET INDIRECT=3' has been executed prior
to CUBE execution, if line "SET VALUES=" exits then replace line with
"SET VALUES=3" else adds line to target bottom.
If no environment variable found then displays an error message and continues with next command.</p>

<pre>REPSTRING "D:\TOOLKT13\IPFC;" WITH "D:\TK13\IPFC" IN "SET HELP="
(LAST</pre>
<p>replaces the string "D:\TOOLKT13\IPFC; with "D:\TK13\IPFC;" within
the last line starting with "SET HELP=".</p>

<pre>REPSTRING "D:\TOOLKT13" WITH "D:\TK13" (all</pre>
<p>replaces all occurrences of "D:\TOOLKT13" with "D:\TK13".</p>

<pre>AL "USER=#name#,NODE=#node#" (AFTER IFNEW key</pre>
<p>assuming CUBE has been invoked with option (KEY "name #ME#
node #HERE#", will adds a line "USER=ME,NODE=HERE" .</p>

<pre>WHEN C</pre>
<p>assuming CUBE has been invoked with option (MAKE C , the following
commands will be executed.</p>

<pre>al !SET MYNAME="#name#"! (key</pre>
<p>assuming CUBE has been  invoked with option (key "name #John Smith#",
will add a line <code>SET MYNAME="John Smith"</code>.</p>


<pre>lineid profile
COMMENT BEGIN ";"
REPLINE " COMPUTERNAME =" WITH " COMPUTERNAME = %hostname% (env"</pre>
<p>a COMPUTERNAME but must have at least one leading space in target.
The with string is still the exact replacement. Any lines beginning
with a semi-colon are ignored. This example for C:\ibmlan\ibmlan.ini as target.</p>

<h3>For more examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>Run <code>test.cmd</code> from <code>cube\text</code> directory which generates a pseudo target file to test most options.</li>
<li><code>cube\text\*.cub.sam</code>  has various samples.</li>
<li><a href="system.html">System Sample</a> is that it tests USB hardware and inserts correct number of drivers in <code>config.sys</code>.</li>
