times.

<p>A general
<a href="mailto://os2-cube@yahoogroups.com">newsgroup</a> has been  created.</p>

<p>A collection of REXX scripts to configure SWC and eCS config.sys,
batches, text profiles, selected WPS objects and INI applications. These will
configure your system without any attention. They are good for the  individual but here
indispensable for configuring a network of clients. They are meant for people who have
some familiarity with OS/2 configuration.</p>

<p>There are now two different drive mappings.
First, <code>C:\</code> is mapped to actual boot drive.
Second, <code>D:\</code> is mapped to the drive  running cube, hereon referred to data drive.
</p>

<p >I modified CUBE to handle multiple boot drives with one source. I liked it so much I wrote scripts to handle
selected WPS objects and INI application in boot drive independent manner. Next, I was concerned about
configuring my LAN which is a real pain. I got scripts for that too.</p>

<p>I have added some new features  to CUBE.   At the risk of controversy I redefined some
infrequent used features of CUBE that were limiting the robustness and
expandability of the language. This resulted in a rewrite of the documentation. Now one can expand
the language and remain 100% compatible existing procedure files. Some of the other tools have
been also updated.<p>

<p>CUBE now requires Object REXX rather than Classic REXX. Unfortunately, in a fresh install
Classic REXX is the default. To switch between the two REXX, type <code>switchrx</code>
at command prompt, enter "y" return and then reboot. For unattended installs, run switchrx
with input redirected from a text file during last phase of the install. A practical work around is
in the works.  I tried Object REXX both SWC and eCS to find eCS 1.0 needed Classic REXX to run
WiseMachine but eCS 1.1, SWC 1 &amp; 2 work no problem.</p>
