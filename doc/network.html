<h1>Network Sample</h1>

<p>Modify this script for your own network.  By network I mean LAN, TCP/IP, MPTN etc.
My network has a DSL/router with NETBIOS LAN. It assumes that system has already
modified "config.sys" and gave all machines a unique hostname.</p>

<table>
 <caption>My Network</caption>
 <col width="100"><col width="100"><col>
 <tbody>
<tr><td>karen</td><td>SWC 2</td><td>static peer to peer</td></tr>
<tr><td>tina</td><td>eCS 1.1</td><td>dynamic client</td></tr>
<tr><td>judy</td><td>Win98 se</td><td>static peer to peer</td></tr>
 </tbody>
</table>


<p>Run "logsys.cmd" and Reboot before using this (see <a href="system.html">system sample</a>).
Using WARP Center drives object select "lognet.cmd", a driver script for
"network.cmd". This sets the path and logs output to "C:\network.log".
Reboot and start surfing.</p>



<h2>VBCOPY network C:\</h2>

<p>These files are part of my LAN that are unlikely to change. If they do change
VBCOPY does VBACK on the original. Its a lot easier VBCOPY them rather
than CUBE every line for each file.</p>

<pre>Directory of D:\cube\copy\network\mptn\etc
10-25-03  9:44p           232      0 a---  TCPOS2.INI</pre>


<h2>CUBE</h2>

<p>I call CUBE while working directory "text" for files that are likely to change.
I assume that changes to "C:\config.sys" are already handled by SYSTEM.</p>

<p>A samples of my cube files are "text\*.cub.sam" with extra extension ".sam".
There are some scripts, "text\*.cmd", to run cube on local copy of files and edit
them. Put a local copy of target in subdirectory "text\sam".  You might have to modify
the script to your own liking.</p>
